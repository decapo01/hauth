# hauth

This is the follow along code with the book Practical Web Development with Haskell.

Please note that if anyone want's to use this that you must change the lts version of stack to

```
resolver: lts-9.11
```

in the stack.yaml file

Also note that each the chapters are stored in their own branch.  I will push to the dev and master branches after completing each chapter.
